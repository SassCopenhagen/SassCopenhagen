Hey there! I'm SassCopenhagen – a mysterious tech enthusiast who fiercely guards their privacy and keeps personal details under wraps. My passion lies in diving deep into the world of coding, cybersecurity, and crafting innovative tools. Below, you'll find my interests, skills, and hardware setup, all presented in a sleek, minimalist style. 😎🔒

## Interests 🚀
- **Hacking** 🔒: I explore security vulnerabilities and develop exploits (including near-0-day ones) for educational and research purposes only.
- **Programming** 💻: I code complex applications and build custom frameworks and tools.
- **Software Engineering** 🛠️: I design scalable software systems with a focus on performance and reliability.
- **UI/UX Design** 🎨: I create intuitive user interfaces, prioritizing exceptional user experiences.

## Programming Languages 🧑‍💻
I’m proficient in over 25 programming languages! Here are some of my favorites:
- Python 🐍 (go-to for rapid prototyping)
- Ruby 💎 (elegant and efficient)
- Rust 🦀 (secure and modern)
- Assembly (ASM) 🔧 (for low-level hacking)
- And many more: C++, Java, JavaScript, Go, Swift, etc.

I love experimenting with new languages and creating my own exploits and frameworks.

## Tools & Technologies 🛡️
Here’s my toolkit for daily work:
- **Code Editors**: VSCode 📝 (primary), Xcode 🍏 (for iOS/macOS)
- **Databases**: SQL 🗄️, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL (and other relational/NoSQL databases)
- **Containerization & Orchestration**: Docker 🐳, Kubernetes ☸️
- **UI/UX Tools**: Figma 🖼️ (for prototyping), Photoshop 🖌️ (for graphic editing)
- **Other**: Git 📚, CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins/GitHub Actions), security analyzers, and debuggers.

## Operating Systems 💻
I work across multiple OSes, tailored to specific projects:
- macOS 🍎 (primary OS for development and design)
- Windows 10 🪟 (for compatibility testing and gaming)
- Arch Linux 🐧 (for advanced hacking, customization, and server tasks)

## My Workstation 🖥️
